### Database Schema
```sql
-- Core entities with relationships
Users (15 fields) → Roadmaps → Steps → Resources
                              ↓
                            Labs ← Lab Sessions
                              ↓
                          Progress Tracking
                              ↓
                         Badges & Gamification
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET/POST /api/roadmaps` - Roadmap management
- `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/roadmaps/[id]` - Individual roadmap operations
- `GET/POST /api/labs` - Lab management
